# Project Conventions

## Git Workflow
- Always create a new dedicated branch for major code changes.
- Branch name format should follow: `feature/[task-slug]` or `fix/[bug-slug]`.

## Supported AI platforms (AG Kit)
- AG Kit **only supports Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity**.
- Do not claim compatibility with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or other assistants unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- Copy on the website, docs, FAQ, README, and marketing should describe AG Kit as a toolkit for Gemini CLI / Antigravity-style agent setups.

## Context Documentation
- **MANDATORY**: Always update the context folder (`context/roadmap.md`, `context/health-monitor-app.md`, and `context/patient_health_monitoring_app_requirements.md`) on every task to keep project status, architecture, and roadmap strictly synchronized with code changes.
